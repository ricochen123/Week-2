# CSCI208 Labwork 2

Please complete lab 2.  You will have to write the `PrintNameList` function that takes *two* parameters, returns *nothing*, but prints the list in a particular format.  This lab is about function calls, array parameters, and loop logic.  Pay particular attention to how the loop should be formatted.  It would be easy if all you had to do was output the list with spaces, but we're going to try to do this in a grammatically correct one.  Here are some examples that you might see:

```
The name is Bob.
The names are Ann, Bob, and Cade.
The names are Frank, Caden, Norma, Gabriella, and Sally.
```


## Building and Running the Program on Hopper
To perform this work, you will have to:
1.  Log into `hopper.winthrop.edu` from your laptop using `ssh` or `PuTTy`
2.  Clone the project onto hopper using `git clone` *project URL*
3.  Change into the project directory: `cd ` *project directory name*
4.  Building using `make`
5.  Run by typing the name of the executable:  `lab2-main.exe`


## How and What to Submit
Submission will happen via this GitHub respository.  So you'll need to make sure you *add* all necessary files , and you will also need to make sure your code is committed and pushed to GitHub *before* the submission due date.  When you are ready for me to grade, please *also* submit something in the BlackBoard assignment to indicate that you are done so I know which commit to grade.

Here are the files that should be present in your repository:
* Your C++ source files
* A `Makefile` that builds your program

**Do not** include object files or your binary executable in the repository.
